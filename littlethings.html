<li>  Splitting a large bowl of 팥빙수 with people you love
<li>  French toast, scrambled eggs, and bacon with a glass of orange juice, Vermont maple syrup, and blueberry syrup
<li>  Pre-college: Waking up late then realizing you have a 2 hour delay because of snow! Or even better, a snow day!
<li>  Cinnamon muffins. Cinnamon toast. Cinnamon buns. Cinnamon tea. Cinnamon sugar. Cinnamon toast crunch. Cinnamon. Ginger snaps and snickerdoodles which are basically in the category of cinnamon.
<li>  Writing on glass windows with grease pencil
<li>  The almost-crinkling sound a sheet of paper makes when it’s completely full of writing (medium: pen)
<li>  Tapping the middle of my thumb against the edge of a page that I’m about to turn
<li>  Paperback books with somewhat crinkly-bound paper (hard to explain, but my childhood copy of A Wrinkle In Time was perfectamundo for making this subtle sound)
<li>  My bangs right before I go to bed or right after running (because why would they ever look good when I’m about to go out in public? No no, only at night/after exercising when no one else is around)
<li>  Using SoftSoap to make giant bubbles (thumb and index finger)
<li>  Clamming at Mystic Seaport: the feeling of the soft muck, running away from crabs, poking the baby jellyfish, and enjoying the fruits of our labor (AKA perfectly salty fresh clams)
<li>  The smell of the ice rink after the ice has been freshly cut
<li>  Solo cello, solo piano, or solo flute
<li>  E.E. Cummings
